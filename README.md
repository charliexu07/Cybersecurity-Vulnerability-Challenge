# Vulnerability-Challenge

This application creates interactive websites hosted on Github Pages where users can learn about various kinds of cybersecurity vulnerabilities and practice their knowledge by attempting to fix vulnerabilities existed in the given code segments.

The modified code segment will be packaged into a .java file along with other codes and be pushed to this repo, and Github action will be triggered. The result of the Github action will be sent back to the user so that the user knows whether the vulnerability has been fixed or not. (This part of functionality is still under development)
